    "- what is a class? - a class is a blueprint for an object that contains some data (attributes/fields) and functions(methods)\n",
    "-functions and methods are pretty much the same thing. Methods need an object to act on or are part of class.. ie methods are functions that are built into a class (methods are functions that are in a class)\n",
    "- method uses . notation with parentheses (ex. aList.sort() is a method)\n",
    "- instance -> copy or spawn of a class. Concrete manifestation that is generated by a class. An object is very flexible in that can be made to look a variety of ways.\n",
